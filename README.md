AWS SageMaker MNIST
===

Train, deploy, and test your own AIML model on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) using Python 3.

---

## What is this?

This is a Jupyter notebook crafted to follow the [Getting Started on Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs.html) tutorial.
It uses the Amazon SageMaker SDK for Python 3.

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a collection of handwritten roman numeral digits, each with their corresponding label. 
This tutorial walks you through using the MNIST dataset to train an AIML model to infer what an arbitrary handwritten digit is,
as well as deploying and testing the AIML on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker).

## What is Amazon SageMaker?

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) is a fully-managed service on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
that covers the entire machine learning workflow to label and prepare your data, choose an (or craft your own) algorithm, 
train a model, tune and optimize it for deployment, make predictions, and take action.
